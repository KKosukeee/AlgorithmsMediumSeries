Hello, I‚Äôm Kosuke Kuzuoka, an AI research engineer at DeNA Co., Ltd. I recently
had a chance to revisit data structures and algorithms, and thought that this
would be a good time to share my knowledge and the implementation written in
python.

I am writing a series of blog posts, covering topics from the basics of data
structures and algorithms to advanced computer science. This blog post is meant
for beginners or people who want to learn the basics about CS topics. All the
code used in this series is in this [Github
repository](https://github.com/KKosukeee/AlgorithmsMediumSeries). Let‚Äôs dive in!

UPDATED: It‚Äôs has been a while since I started this blog post series. I have
been working on this series hard, and publishing a new post every week! Here are
all the links to the posts published in this series so far. Enjoy üòé

### **What are Data Structures?**

In short, data structures are the ways of storing data in your computer. I
assume you know about arrays and lists. An array is a data structure that can
store a big chunk of data. You can do a lot of things with arrays, but arrays
have some cons as well. In some cases, other data structures like a linked list
is better, and sometimes not.

One good property of an array is that it has constant time lookup if you know
the index. Constant time lookup means that no matter how much data you have in
the array, it will take roughly the same amount of time to get data from the
array if you know the index. Let‚Äôs look at some examples.

I created 1k arrays with sizes ranging from 1 to 1k, then I picked a random
index which is in the range and calculated how many times it took to look up an
element from the array. You can see that the lookup time doesn‚Äôt really change
as the number of elements increases in the array. This means that there is
almost no correlation between the time it takes for the lookup and the number of
elements in the array.

But arrays have some cons as well. Arrays have linear time when you insert an
element into it, while the other data structures like linked-lists have constant
time. I won‚Äôt go into too much detail since both data structures will be
explained in a later post in this blog series. The takeaway here is that you can
write more efficient code if you have a good understanding of data structures
and algorithms.

### What are Algorithms?

In short, algorithms are the ways of solving problems using different types of
data structures. Algorithms can be very difficult to understand, but let‚Äôs look
at a simple example to understand what an algorithm looks like. Below is an
example question asked on[ LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

    Given an array of integers, return 
     of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

    You may assume that each input would have 
     one solution, and you may not use the 
     element twice.

    Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

    Because nums[
    ] + nums[
    ] = 2 + 7 = 9,
    return [
    , 
    ].

The problem you need to solve here is pretty obvious. You basically need to find
a pair of numbers that add up to the target value and return the indices of both
two numbers. A simple algorithm you can come up with is to have one loop that
goes through the numbers one by one, and another loop for checking whether the
pair of numbers add up to the target or not. Let‚Äôs look at the naive approach to
solve this problem in code.

This code obviously works, but it has two loops ‚Äî one for checking each number
and the other one for checking if any number in the array add up to the target
value. In fact you can remove the inner loop to clean up the code if you know
other data structures, such as using hash maps instead of using arrays. Let‚Äôs
write the algorithm without the inner loop, instead using hash maps.

In fact both of these algorithms solve this particular problem. Both of them
produce the same result. The important thing here is that if you have a good
understanding of data structures and algorithms, then you can write very
efficient code. But how do you really know how much faster your efficient
algorithm runs? This is where Big-O notation comes into play!

### What is Big-O notation?

I introduced two algorithms to solve a simple problem. Both of them solve the
problem but one of them runs much faster than the other, and I want to show you
how to prove that this is the case.

I ran both functions from above with exactly the same input and target. The
result is that the optimal approach runs slightly faster than the other
function, but the difference between them is really insignificant. Now let‚Äôs
increase the size of an array to see what happens.

You can clearly see the difference between the two functions is more significant
than before. Can you guess why? The answer to that question is that the runtime
of the naive approach grows exponentially as the size of the array increases.
Big-O notation is great for expressing the relationship of runtime and the size
of an array.

Big-O notation indicates the efficiency of your algorithm given an input. Let‚Äôs
imagine the size of an input array is N. How many times do you think the loop
runs through for the naive approach? The outer loop runs through 0 to N and the
inner loop runs through i + 1 to N. This is very common behavior for algorithms,
and the total amount of times the loop runs is N(N-1)/2 times. This is exactly
the same as saying ‚ÄúIf the size of an input is N, then the run time for the
function is going to be N(N-1)/2‚Äù, and this is very close to the definition of
Big-O notation with one more modification ‚Äî which you would like for sure ;)

<span class="figcaption_hack">Image source: [http://bigocheatsheet.com/](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)</span>

In fact Big-O notation doesn‚Äôt care about exact runtime, but the approximate
runtime. If you do some math for the runtime that I defined above, it would
become N¬≤-N/2. Big-O only cares about the most significant term of the equation
and ignores everything else. So the runtime for the naive approach and optimal
approach becomes O(N¬≤) and O(N) respectively. There are other metrics you can
use to explain the complexity of your algorithms, such as Big-Œ© or Big-Œò. But
Big-O is the most commonly used one among those, so I won‚Äôt explain how Big-Œ© or
Big-Œò differ from Big-O. The takeaway from this section is that with Big-O
notation, you can explain the efficiency for your algorithm.

### Conclusion

In this blog post, I shared more information about data structures and
algorithms. It‚Äôs always better to write efficient programs in terms of runtime
and space on your computer. You might not use those algorithms in your work, but
sometimes it really helps to write efficient software, so it‚Äôs definitely worth
the time. You might be learning the data structures and algorithms for your
upcoming interview or for your college classes. In either case, I hope this blog
post helped you understand the basics of the topic.

In the next blog post of this series, I will talk about some data structures
which are widely used for software development. Thanks a lot for reading through
this blog post. I will do my best to write the next post ASAP, but in the
meantime, make sure you leave 50 claps to motivate my next post ;)
